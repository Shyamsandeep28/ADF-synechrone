 Hands-On Lab: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure Data Factory
🎯 Goal:
You’ll learn how to apply RBAC in Azure Data Factory so that only authorized users can access or perform actions like creating pipelines, monitoring activities, or accessing linked services.
=======================================================================================
🛠️ Prerequisites:
Azure Subscription

Azure Data Factory (already created)

Azure Active Directory User (or you can create one dummy user for this test)

Basic knowledge of ADF UI
=======================================================================================
✅ Steps Overview:
Create a test user in Azure AD (if you don’t have one)

Assign RBAC role to the user for ADF

Login with that user and validate permissions

Test access with different roles (Reader, Contributor, Data Factory Contributor, etc.)
=======================================================================================

🔄 Step-by-step Instructions
🔹 Step 1: Create a Test User in Azure AD
If you already have a second user to test with, skip this step.

Go to Azure Portal → search Azure Active Directory

Go to Users → Click + New user

Fill basic info (Name, username) → Create user

Note down the username and temporary password
=======================================================================================
🔹 Step 2: Assign RBAC Role to the User on ADF
Go to your Azure Data Factory instance

On the left menu → Click Access Control (IAM)

Click + Add → Add role assignment

Choose Role: Select one of the following based on the scenario:

🔹 Reader: Can only view ADF, not edit

🔹 Data Factory Contributor: Can create and manage ADF pipelines

🔹 Contributor: Can manage everything except access control

In Assign access to: Select User, group, or service principal

Search and select the user you created earlier

Click Review + assign

✅ Done! The user now has a role on ADF.
=======================================================================================
🔹 Step 3: Login with Test User and Validate
Open a new browser/incognito window

Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in with the test user credentials

Reset password when prompted

Navigate to Data Factory → Open the same instance

🔍 Now test what the user can or cannot do:

If Reader: Try editing pipeline → You’ll get access denied

If Contributor or ADF Contributor: Try creating new pipeline, dataset, etc.
=======================================================================================
🔄 Step 4: Change Roles and Re-Test (Optional)
Go back to the original admin account and:

Change the user’s role (e.g., downgrade from Contributor to Reader)

Log back in with the test user and validate limited access
